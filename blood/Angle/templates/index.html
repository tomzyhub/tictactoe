<h1>loving is beautiful</h1>

<p> Being deeply loved by someone gives you strength, while loving someone deeply gives you courage." “There is always some madness in love. But there is also always some reason in madness." “The greatest happiness of life is the conviction that we are loved; loved for ourselves,
  or rather, loved in spite of ourselves."</p>
